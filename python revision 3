(1).Create a function that takes a string as input and capitalizes a letter if its ASCII codeis even and returns its lower case version if its ASCII code is odd.
def capatlize_ascii(s):
    sring=""
    for i in s:
        if ord(i) % 2 == 0:
            string+=i.upper()
        else:
            string+=i.lower()
    return string        
capatlize_ascii("to be or not to be!")   


(2).You are given a list of tuples where each tuple contains a student's name and their marks.
Write a program to find and print the name(s) of the student(s) who scored the highest marks.

def highest_score(a):
    marks=max(marks for name , marks in a)
    for i in a:
        if i[1]==marks:
            return i[0]
a=[("yuvraj",1),("abhay",2),("gourav",0),("sakshi",100)] 
highest_score(a)

(3).finding and printing pairs of elements whose sum is 0 from the list
a=[1,2,3,4,-1,-2,0]
def two_sum(a):
    for i in range(len(a)):
        for j in range(i+1,len(a)):
            if a[i]+a[j]==0:
                return True
    return False
two_sum(a)
