Create a function that takes a string as input and capitalizes a letter if its ASCII codeis even and returns its lower case version if its ASCII code is odd.
def capatlize_ascii(s):
    sring=""
    for i in s:
        if ord(i) % 2 == 0:
            string+=i.upper()
        else:
            string+=i.lower()
    return string        
capatlize_ascii("to be or not to be!")
